# E04a-Sprites
This is an exercise to start playing with sprites and physics in Godot.
 
 This was a fun little into intro the workflow and panel/toolbar setup of Godot. I am used to working in Blender, Maya, and Unity and this seems very familiar but potentially much more organized and simplified. However, I think I would be much more comfortable creating 3D models in Maya whenever we get into 3d gaming. I hope the 3D mesh files are compatible/importable so I can take advantage of my familiararity with the Maya workflow to save myself time. I enjoy this side of game design MUCH MUCH MUCH more than coding.
